# Todo4U
Simple smart todo for codezilla

I developed this for the "codezilla open source product development inter university hackathon organized by Mozilla Campus Club â€“ UWU"

This is a simple todo app for firefox which is somewhat similar to the keep extension in google chrome. This is coded using javascript and the firefox documentation,stack overflow and some youtube tutorials were used as guidance.

#Install To install this type about:debugging in the url box and click "load temporary addon" and load the manifest.jason file. This will add the addon to firefox

#Change Settings To store todos, I have used sync storage, because this enables the user to use the extension's data in multiple devices using the same account. But unfortunately the sync storage only provides 100kb per user. To use the addon we have to activate sync storage in settings. To do this, type about:preferences in url bar, and search for "Sync Settings" and check the addons box. Now we are ready to use the addon.

#Usage This simple addon provides saving todos, scheduling todos, notifying the user in the given time, saving the url of the current tab, deleting the todos when unnecessary etc.
